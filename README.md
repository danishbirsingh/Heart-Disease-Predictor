# Heart-Disease-Predictor

**DESCRIPTION**

Machine learning based model to predict the condition of the heart using kaggle heart disease dataset.

**Data Dictionary:**

  • Age - Age of patient

  •	Sex - Sex of patient

  • CP - Chest pain type (4 values)

  •	trestbps - Resting blood pressure

  •	chol - Serum cholestoral in mg/dl

  •	fbs - Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

  •	restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

  •	thalach - Maximum heart rate achieved

  • exang - Exercise induced angina

  • oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

  • slope - Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

  • ca - Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

  •	thal - 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect

**TASK:**

To predict the condition of heart of a patient i.e. whether it is healthy or defective by user input.

**Tools Used:**

• Programming Lnaguage - Python

• Algorithm - Logistic Regression 

• IDE - Google Collab
