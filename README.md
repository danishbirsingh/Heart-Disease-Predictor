# Heart Disease Predictor

## Description

The **Heart Disease Predictor** is a machine learning model designed to predict the condition of the heart using the Kaggle heart disease dataset. This model utilizes data-driven insights to determine whether a patient's heart is healthy or exhibiting signs of a potential heart condition.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises various features that contribute to the prediction of heart disease. Here's a breakdown of the important features:

- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient.
- **CP**: Chest pain type (with four possible values).
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure of the patient.
- **chol**: Serum cholestoral level in mg/dl.
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar greater than 120 mg/dl.
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2).
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina.
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
- **thal**: Thalassemia category (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect).

## Task

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can determine the condition of a patient's heart based on the provided features. By analyzing the dataset and training a machine learning algorithm, we aim to accurately classify whether a patient's heart is healthy or exhibiting signs of heart disease. The trained model can then be used to make predictions for new patient data.

## Methodology

The project employs the following tools and techniques:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Jupyter Notebook

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Dataset Analysis**: The project begins by loading and analyzing the heart disease dataset. Each feature is carefully examined to understand its significance and potential impact on heart disease prediction.

2. **Feature Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical variables into numerical ones, and perform feature scaling if necessary.

3. **Model Selection**: Logistic Regression is chosen as the algorithm for heart disease prediction due to its suitability for binary classification tasks.

4. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

5. **Model Training**: The logistic regression model is trained on the training data, allowing it to learn the relationships between features and heart disease outcomes.

6. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using the testing data. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's predictive capabilities.

7. **User Interaction**: The final model is integrated into a user-friendly interface. Users can input their information, and the model predicts whether their heart is healthy or not.

## Conclusion

The Heart Disease Predictor leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and provide insights into their heart health. By utilizing logistic regression, the model can make accurate predictions based on a variety of factors. This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and machine learning in the medical domain, contributing to proactive healthcare and early detection of potential heart conditions.
